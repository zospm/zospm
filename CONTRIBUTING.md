## How to contribute to zospm

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/zospm/zospm/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/zospm/zospm/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant infor

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of zospm will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

Suggest your change in the [Team Discussion Forums](https://github.com/orgs/zospm/teams) and start writing code. Here are the 3 forums:
 - [cicd](https://github.com/orgs/zospm/teams/cicd): Discussion on the zospm CI/CD tooling
 - [core](https://github.com/orgs/zospm/teams/core): Discussion on the core zospm package manager repository
 - [pkgdev](https://github.com/orgs/zospm/teams/pkgdev): Discussion on the zospm software package repositories

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

Ask any question about how to use zospm in the [zospm core forum](https://github.com/orgs/zospm/teams/core).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the zospm documentation?**

We have a significant need for both internal documentation (error messages and help) as well as external documentation (how to use zospm). Please suggest your ideas in the [zospm core forum](https://github.com/orgs/zospm/teams/core). 

zospm is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and [join the team](https://github.com/orgs/zospm/people)!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
